Project 3: Frogger

This program was implemented to imitate the classic game Frogger.

The entire program consists of one html file, a css folder which contains one css file, a js folder which contains three js and an images folder which contains six png files.

To run the program, open the index.html file.

The program is coded to where four rows of bugs (cars) move across the screen at random speeds.

The player must attempt to move from one end of the screen to the water at the top without colliding with a bug, which is a win.

If the player makes it to the water successfully, then the player's location is reset and a rock is placed on the ground until five rocks are placed; once five rocks are on the ground, the rocks stay at five and are randomly rearranged with each succesive win.

The rocks are obstructions that the player has to go around.

If the player collides with a bug, then the player's location is reset to its initial location, and no additional rock is added.

The corresponding Up, Down, Left & Right keys should be used in order to control the motion of the player on the screen.
